# Machine-Learning-in-Biomedical-Science
This git-repo might be useful for self-learning and skill developvent. Since large accumulation of biological and biomedical data, application of Artificial Intelligenece (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) makes a great deal to perform several challenges both in fundamental research or practical situations. Here some case-wise solutions have been provided to apply of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to solve real-life biomedical challenges e.g. drug discovery, biomedical data analysis, prediction of patient treatment results and and other related heathcare issues. 

# Focus areas and workflow:
The primary focus areas regarding application of ML in healthcare, in this repository, have been limited to: 
1. Introducing Python and R programming for Machine Learning (a preliminary understanding on how to use programming languages to collect, organize, resample and visualize data).
2. Tree Models in Machine Learning (Underlying principles of Tree-based models e.g. Decision Tree in ML, how to build them and how to evaluate them through programming). 
3. Artificial Neural Network in Machine Learning (An exiciting part of ML in desicion making by mimicking how human brain works. It's more complicated than simply hearing about!!).
4. ML - an Art (Best practices of ML real-life situations. Here, only in healthcare and pharmaceutical industries). 

# Prerequisites:
Programming lagunages - Python and R (obligatory), Unix-based Command Lines (optional)
